# LB challenge

These four sql queries were created in response to a coding exercise given me as part of an interview process.

The file names follow the format: ex\<X\>_\<description\>.sql,
where \<X\> is is the problem number as presented in the exercise
and \<description\> briefly states what is trying to be determined.
